    longname: user name for package
    description: is the user-defined name for the package. PNAME is restricted to
      16 characters.  No spaces are allowed in PNAME.  PNAME character values are
      read and stored by the program for stress packages only.  These names may be
      useful for labeling purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type
      are located within a single GWT Model.  If PNAME is specified for a stress package,
      then PNAME will be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will
      also be used for the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  PNAME is case
      insensitive and is stored in all upper case letters.
