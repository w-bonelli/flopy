      of the well RATE or the well inflow rate from the aquifer. HEAD\_LIMIT can be
      applied to extraction wells (RATE $<$ 0) or injection wells (RATE $>$ 0). HEAD\_LIMIT
      can be deactivated by specifying the text string `OFF'. The HEAD\_LIMIT option
      is based on the HEAD\_LIMIT functionality available in the MNW2~\citep{konikow2009}
      package for MODFLOW-2005. The HEAD\_LIMIT option has been included to facilitate
      backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW but use of the RATE\_SCALING
      option instead of the HEAD\_LIMIT option is recommended. By default, HEAD\_LIMIT
      is `OFF'.

      applied to injection wells (RATE$<0$) and if HEAD\_LIMIT is specified (not set
      to `OFF').  If HEAD\_LIMIT is specified, SHUT\_OFF can be deactivated by specifying
      a minimum value equal to zero. The SHUT\_OFF option is based on the SHUT\_OFF
      functionality available in the MNW2~\citep{konikow2009} package for MODFLOW-2005.
      The SHUT\_OFF option has been included to facilitate backward compatibility

      of the SHUT\_OFF option is recommended. By default, SHUT\_OFF is not used.

    description: is the minimum rate that a well must exceed to shutoff a well during

      to the well from the aquifer is less than MINRATE. If a well is shut down during

      to reduce oscillations. MINRATE must be less than maxrate.

      was shutdown during the previous time step and the flow rate to the well from
      the aquifer exceeds maxrate. Reactivation of the well cannot occur until the
      next time step if a well is shutdown to reduce oscillations. maxrate must be

      and SCALING\_LENGTH must be specified. RATE\_SCALING cannot be used with HEAD\_LIMIT.  RATE\_SCALING
      can be used for extraction or injection wells.  For extraction wells, the extraction
      rate will start to decrease once the head in the well lowers to a level equal
      to the pump elevation plus the scaling length.  If the head in the well drops
      below the pump elevation, then the extraction rate is calculated to be zero.  For
      an injection well, the injection rate will begin to decrease once the head in
      the well rises above the specified pump elevation.  If the head in the well
      rises above the pump elevation plus the scaling length, then the injection rate
      will be set to zero.
