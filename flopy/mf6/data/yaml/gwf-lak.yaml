    longname: extraction rate
    description: real or character value that defines the extraction rate for the
      lake outflow. A positive value indicates inflow and a negative value indicates
      outflow from the lake. RATE only applies to outlets associated with active lakes
      (STATUS is ACTIVE). A specified RATE is only applied if COUTTYPE for the OUTLETNO

    description: real or character value that defines the width of the lake outlet.
      A specified WIDTH value is only used for active lakes if COUTTYPE for lake outlet
      OUTLETNO is not SPECIFIED. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry
