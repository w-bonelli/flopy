    description: name of the binary output file to write density information.  The
      density file has the same format as the head file.  Density values will be written
      to the density file whenever heads are written to the binary head file.  The
      settings for controlling head output are contained in the Output Control option.

    longname: use equivalent freshwater head formulation
    description: use the variable-density equivalent freshwater head formulation instead
      of the hydraulic head head formulation.  This dev option has only been implemented
      for confined aquifer conditions and should generally not be used.

      and less than or equal to NRHOSPECIES. Information must be specified for each
      of the NRHOSPECIES species or the program will terminate with an error.  The
      program will also terminate with an error if information for a species is specified
      more than once.

    shape: null
    reader: urword
    longname: auxspeciesname
    description: name of an auxiliary variable in a GWF stress package that will be
      used for this species to calculate a density value.  If a density value is needed
      by the Buoyancy Package then it will use the concentration values in this AUXSPECIESNAME
      column in the density equation of state.  For advanced stress packages (LAK,
      SFR, MAW, and UZF) that have an associated advanced transport package (LKT,
      SFT, MWT, and UZT), the FLOW\_PACKAGE\_AUXILIARY\_NAME option in the advanced
      transport package can be used to transfer simulated concentrations into the
      flow package auxiliary variable.  In this manner, the Buoyancy Package can calculate
      density values for lakes, streams, multi-aquifer wells, and unsaturated zone
      flow cells using simulated concentrations.
