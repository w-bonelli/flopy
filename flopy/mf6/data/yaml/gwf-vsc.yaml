      viscosity file has the same format as the head file.  Viscosity values will
      be written to the viscosity file whenever heads are written to the binary head

    description: integer value that defines the species number associated with the
      specified PACKAGEDATA data entered on each line. IVISCSPECIES must be greater
      than zero and less than or equal to NVISCSPECIES. Information must be specified

  dviscdc:

    description: real value that defines the slope of the line defining the linear
      relationship between viscosity and temperature or between viscosity and concentration,
      depending on the type of species entered on each line.  If the value of AUXSPECIESNAME
      entered on a line corresponds to TEMPERATURE\_SPECIES\_NAME (in the OPTIONS
      block), this value will be used when VISCOSITY\_FUNC is equal to LINEAR (the
      default) in the OPTIONS block.  When VISCOSITY\_FUNC is set to NONLINEAR, a
      value for DVISCDC must be specified though it is not used.
  cviscref:
    type: double precision

    reader: urword
    longname: reference temperature value or reference concentration value
    description: real value that defines the reference temperature or reference concentration
      value used for this species in the viscosity equation of state.  If AUXSPECIESNAME
      entered on a line corresponds to TEMPERATURE\_SPECIES\_NAME (in the OPTIONS
      block), then CVISCREF refers to a reference temperature, otherwise it refers
      to a reference concentration.
  modelname:
    type: string
    in_record: true
    tagged: false
    shape: null
    reader: urword
    longname: modelname
    description: name of a GWT model used to simulate a species that will be used
      in the viscosity equation of state.  This name will have no effect if the simulation
      does not include a GWT model that corresponds to this GWF model.
  auxspeciesname:
    type: string
    in_record: true
    tagged: false
    shape: null
    reader: urword
    longname: auxspeciesname
    description: name of an auxiliary variable in a GWF stress package that will be
      used for this species to calculate the viscosity values.  If a viscosity value
      is needed by the Viscosity Package then it will use the temperature or concentration
      values associated with this AUXSPECIESNAME in the viscosity equation of state.  For
      advanced stress packages (LAK, SFR, MAW, and UZF) that have an associated advanced
      transport package (LKT, SFT, MWT, and UZT), the FLOW\_PACKAGE\_AUXILIARY\_NAME
      option in the advanced transport package can be used to transfer simulated temperature
      or concentration(s) into the flow package auxiliary variable.  In this manner,
      the Viscosity Package can calculate viscosity values for lakes, streams, multi-aquifer
      wells, and unsaturated zone flow cells using simulated concentrations.
